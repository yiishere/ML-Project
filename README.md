## Machine Learning Projects Overview
Through these projects, I have applied machine learning techniques across diverse domains, including regression, classification, clustering, fairness analysis, NLP, and time-series forecasting. I have gained hands-on experience in building predictive models, handling real-world datasets, applying feature engineering, and evaluating model performance using various metrics. These projects have deepened my understanding of algorithm selection, model optimization, and the ethical considerations of AI, allowing me to develop practical solutions for real-world challenges.

### Used Car Price Prediction 
- Goal: Assist buyers and sellers in pricing used cars fairly.)
- Applied regression models (Linear, Ridge, LASSO, Elastic Net) to predict used car prices based on key features like year, manufacturer, and mileage. Evaluated models using R² score and RMSE to assess predictive accuracy.

### Classification of Medical Treatment 
- Goal: Improve healthcare decision-making by predicting treatment necessity.
- Developed logistic regression models with different regularization techniques (L1, L2, none) to classify whether a patient requires a treatment. Assessed performance using accuracy, precision, and false-positive rates.

### Patient Genetic Fingerprint Clustering (K-means & PCA) 
- Goal: Identify genetic similarities among patients for personalized healthcare.
- Used K-means clustering and PCA to group patients based on their genetic fingerprints. Applied Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters and visualized results in a reduced-dimensional space.

### Fairness in Measuring Happiness 
- Goal: Ensure unbiased predictions of happiness scores across different ethnic groups.
- Built three predictive models (Race-Aware, Race-Blind, and Fair Model) to evaluate bias in happiness predictions. Assessed fairness using correlation analysis and scatterplots, applying debiasing techniques to mitigate disparities.

### Sentiment Analysis in Tweet Classification 
- Goal: Analyze public sentiment on COVID-19 using social media data.
- Utilized NLP techniques to classify tweets into sentiment categories. Implemented CNN with word embedding and Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB) with TF-IDF and Word Count Vectors. Measured performance using classification accuracy.

### Time Series Analysis: Weather Forecasting 
- Goal: Improve short-term weather prediction accuracy.
- Developed a weather prediction model using time series forecasting with LSTM and GRU. Built a baseline model leveraging seasonality and compared results using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate forecasting accuracy.
